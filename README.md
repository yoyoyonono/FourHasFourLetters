# FourHasFourLetters
I watched Matt Parker's video on the topic, find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYKn0yUTIU4. I decided to make my own python script to automate the process.

It's a .py file. If you don't know how to run these things you probably shouldn't be here. If you don't know how to use it, just look at the code, it should be self explanitory.

I don't care what you use this for, just try and credit me if you can.
