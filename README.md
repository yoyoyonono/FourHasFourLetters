# FourHasFourLetters
I watched Matt Parker's video on the topic, find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYKn0yUTIU4. I decided to make my own python script to automate the process.

FourHasFourLetters27.py is the Python 2.7 version.
FourHasFourLetters3.py is the Python 3 version.

I decided that with the end of life of Python 2.7 scheduled for 2020, that I would stop working on the Python 2.7 version of the program. It shouldn't matter because there isn't much that can be added to a program like this. All future updates, if any will only be added to the Python 3 version unless there is some kind of emergency.
If you don't know how to use the program, just look at the code, it should be self explanitory.

I don't care what you use this for, just try and credit me if you can.
