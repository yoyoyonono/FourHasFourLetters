I watched Matt Parker's video on the topic, find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYKn0yUTIU4. I decided to make my own python script to automate the process.

It's a .py file for Python 2.7. If you don't know how to run these things then you can google "Python 2.7" and you will find sufficient instructions. If you don't know how to use the program, just look at the code, it should be self explanitory.

I don't care what you use this for, just try and credit me if you can.
